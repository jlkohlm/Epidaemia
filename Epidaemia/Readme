Package comes with two branches with applications:

- Epidemic, which runs the simulations;
- Epidemic2D, a 2D-graphic exposures of the simulations evolution.

First, you should run Epidemic to get data for Epidemic2D to run.

Installation:

Unzip the package wherever you may do it.

To run apps use the command:

$ java -jar [Path]/[app-name].jar

	[app-name] may be Epidemic or Epidemic2D.

Defining aliases or short cuts and putting them on the Desktoo would give you ways to run them easily.
